### Hey, I'm Manuchim👋
*Getting to know me*

- 🔭 Transitioned from Civil engineering to tech. Learning new things and taking on new projects, it's exciting and I'll be sharing with you guys in a bit
- 🌱 I recently concluded the State University of New York's blockchain specialization and I'm constantly building on what I've learned. That basically makes this a journal lol
- 👯 I consider myself a doer. I love turning ideas and concepts into reality that we can interact with , the more exciting, the better.
