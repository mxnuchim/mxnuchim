### Hey, I'm Manuchim, and I happen to have a lot of ideas ðŸ‘‹
*Getting to know me*

- ðŸ”­ Soo I'm transitioning from engineering to tech. Learning new things and taking on new projects, it's exciting and I'll be sharing with you guys in a bit
- ðŸŒ± I just concluded Google's data analytics professional certificate and I'm using the knowledge I gained to challenge myself with projects and learn
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m a bit of a number nerd lol. I love turning rows and columns of numbers into exciting stories, the more exciting, the better
- ðŸ“« I do have a twitter if you wanna keep up with me, it's [@manuchim_ix](https://twitter.com/twitter_handle)
