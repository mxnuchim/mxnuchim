### Hey, I'm Manuchim, and I have a lot of ideas ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ *Getting to know me*
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently transitioning from engineering to tech. It's a really exciting journey I'm on, learning new things and taking on new projects, all of which I'll be sharing with you guys in a bit
- ðŸ‘¯ I just concluded Google's data analytics professional certificate and I'm using the knowledge I gained to challenge myself with projects and learn
- ðŸ¤” I'm excited to share my Data journey with you along the way and would love for you to watch my progress. It'll be anything but boring so feel free to hop on lol
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I may not look it, but I'm actually a number nerd lol. I love turning rows and columns of numbers into exciting stories, the more eciting, the better
