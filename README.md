### Hey, I'm ManuchimðŸ‘‹
*Getting to know me*

- ðŸ”­ Soo I'm transitioning from Civil engineering to tech. Learning new things and taking on new projects, it's exciting and I'll be sharing with you guys in a bit
- ðŸŒ± I recently concluded the State University of New York's blockchain specialization and I'm constantly building on what I've learned. That basically makes this a journal lol
- ðŸ‘¯ I consider myself a doer. I love turning ideas into real things that exist and we can interact with , the more exciting, the better. That's probably what got me into Blockchain development 
- ðŸ“« I do have a twitter if you wanna keep up with me, it's [@manuchim_ix](https://twitter.com/twitter_handle)
- âš¡ I'm learning, growing and documenting it all here. It'll be anything but boring so feel free to hop on lol. Feel free to teach me something too. Thankss
